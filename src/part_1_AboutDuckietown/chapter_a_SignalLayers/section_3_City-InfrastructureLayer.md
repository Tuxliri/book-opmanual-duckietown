# Infrastructure Layer 

```{note}
The infrastructure layer is made of [traffic lights](dt-ops-traffic-lights) and [watchtowers](dt-ops-watchtowers).
```

Infrastructure elements sit on the floor layer, outside the lanes, and interact with the Duckiebots in town.

Traffic lights and watchtowers are proper robots: they have computation, sensing, memory and actuation capabilities. As such, they can be programmed to exhibit behaviors, including communication with other agents.

The most fundamental behavior of a traffic light is to signal (stop and go) to the Duckiebots at intersections. 

The most fundamental behavior of watchtowers is to localize Duckiebots and communicate their position to other agents. A network of watchtowers is the first step to building a [Duckietown Autolab](autolab-ops:intro).

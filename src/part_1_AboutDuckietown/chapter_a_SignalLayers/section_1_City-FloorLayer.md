# Floor Layer 

The floor layer is the substrate on which Duckiebots drive, i.e., the road.

Duckietown roads are obtained by applying colored lane markings to a black background. 

Duckietown cities are a concatenation of fundamental building blocks: straight, curves, 3-way and 4-way intersections, and empty blocks. We often refer to these block as _tiles_, because of the medium we assemble them upon.

Each city tile has rigorously defined geometry and color pattern. These definitions are detailed in the [appearance specifications](dt-ops-appearance-specifications).

```{note}
Road markings convey important information to the Duckiebots: 
* delimiting the lanes (white and yellow markings), and
* identifying stop signs (red markings).

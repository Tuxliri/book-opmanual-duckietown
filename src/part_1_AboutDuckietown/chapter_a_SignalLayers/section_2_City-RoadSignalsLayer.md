# Signals Layer 

The signals layer is made of [traffic signs](dt-ops-city-traffic-signs).  

Traffic signs sit on the road layer, outside the lanes, and can serve multiple purposes.

```{seealso}
The full set of currently existing signs is available [here](https://github.com/duckietown/signs-and-tags).
```

## Functional purposes

Some examples of uses of traffic signs that have a function (these functions are encoded in some Duckietown legacy behaviors):

```{note}
Traffic signs:
* identify the type of intersection (3- or 4-way);
* identify the position of the Duckiebot at the intersection;
* inform the Duckiebot of the coordination mechanism for this specific intersection (centralized or decentralized).
```
## Non-functional purposes

Traffic signs can be used for other purposes (these functions are not encoded in any Duckietown out-of-the-box behavior):

```{note}
Traffic signs can moreover be used for:
* naming roads (and making the department head happy);
* identifying pedestrian traffic areas;
* identifying parking lots.
```
